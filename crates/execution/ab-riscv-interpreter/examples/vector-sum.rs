//! Vector extensions, and the execution environment they ask for.
//!
//! Everything the previous examples needed from an environment was small enough to fit in a couple
//! of trait methods. Vectors are where that stops being true: the instruction set needs a vector
//! register file, the CSRs that describe how it is currently interpreted (`vtype`, `vl`,
//! `vstart`, ...), and it needs them to start out in the state the specification calls for. That
//! is what [`Env`] below is, and it is the interesting part of this example.
//!
//! Two things are configuration rather than instructions, which is why they are constants of
//! [`VectorRegisters`] instead of inherited instruction sets: `ELEN`, the widest element the
//! implementation supports, and `VLEN`, how wide a vector register is. `Zve64x` and `Zvl128b`,
//! which the guest was compiled for, are exactly those two numbers.
//!
//! The guest itself is a plain `for` loop over a slice, see
//! `examples/guests/src/bin/vector-sum.rs`: compiled for a target with a vector extension, LLVM
//! turns it into a strip-mined vector loop that reconfigures `vl` on every iteration, so this runs
//! the real thing rather than a hand-written sequence of vector instructions.
